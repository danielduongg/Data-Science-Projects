# Data-Science-Projects

#1
  Social media has provided a platform for users to communicate, interact, express opinions, and share information throughout various communities. Within the vast amount of user-generated content, there are potential insights that can be found by analyzing this data. Using machine learning, researchers can learn valuable patterns and insights that can be used to help make decisions on tasks like:
  Sentiment analysis
  Social network analysis
  Recommending content and products
  Predicting trends
  Improving customer engagement
  In this project, I worked with real Twitter (now X) data to find patterns in the way people use social media. The purpose of this project is to explore a real dataset and come up with our own data question that can be solved using data science. I went through each step of the data science process such as cleaning and preparing the data, analyzing features, training a machine learning model, and summarizing the insights.
